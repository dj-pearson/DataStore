## Best Practices & Lessons Learned

### Component Architecture Best Practices

#### 1. Roblox Plugin Component System

- **Use correct file extensions for Argon sync**:
  - `.luau` → ModuleScript (for components that need to be required)
  - `.client.luau` → LocalScript (for client-side only scripts)
  - `.server.luau` → Script (for server-side scripts)
- **ModuleScripts can only require other ModuleScripts** - never LocalScripts or Scripts
- **Component structure**: All UI components should be ModuleScripts with a `mount(parent)` method

#### 2. Error Prevention Guidelines

- **Always add nil checks** when accessing potentially undefined values
- **Use `or` operators** for safe defaults: `(value or 0)` instead of just `value`
- **Wrap API calls in pcall** for graceful error handling
- **Test edge cases** like empty data, missing services, or nil values

#### 3. Component Development Pattern

```lua
-- Standard component template
local ComponentName = {}
ComponentName.__index = ComponentName

function ComponentName.new(services)
    local self = setmetatable({}, ComponentName)
    self.services = services or {}
    return self
end

function ComponentName:mount(parent)
    if not parent then
        return nil
    end

    -- Create UI elements
    local mainFrame = Instance.new("Frame")
    -- ... UI creation logic

    return mainFrame
end

return ComponentName
```

#### 4. Service Integration Best Practices

- **Always check if services exist** before using them
- **Provide fallback behavior** when services are unavailable
- **Use consistent service naming** across components
- **Pass services through constructor** rather than global access

### Debugging & Troubleshooting

#### 1. Common Error Patterns

- **"Attempted to call require with invalid argument(s)"** → Wrong file extension (LocalScript vs ModuleScript)
- **"attempt to compare number < nil"** → Missing nil checks in calculations
- **"Module not found"** → Incorrect require path or missing file

#### 2. Debugging Strategy

1. **Check file extensions first** - most common issue
2. **Verify require paths** match actual file structure
3. **Add debug logging** to track component loading
4. **Test with minimal data** before adding complexity
5. **Use pcall for error isolation** in complex operations

#### 3. Error Recovery Process

1. **Identify root cause** - don't just treat symptoms
2. **Document the problem** for future reference
3. **Implement proper fix** with error prevention
4. **Test thoroughly** before considering complete
5. **Update documentation** with lessons learned

### Development Workflow

#### 1. Component Creation Checklist

- [ ] Use correct file extension (`.luau` for components)
- [ ] Implement standard component pattern
- [ ] Add proper nil checks and error handling
- [ ] Test with real and mock data
- [ ] Document component purpose and usage
- [ ] Build and test in Roblox Studio

#### 2. Integration Testing

- [ ] Test component loading and mounting
- [ ] Verify service integration works
- [ ] Test error scenarios (missing data, services)
- [ ] Check UI responsiveness and layout
- [ ] Validate real data integration

#### 3. Quality Assurance

- [ ] No console errors during normal operation
- [ ] Graceful degradation when services unavailable
- [ ] Professional UI appearance maintained
- [ ] Performance acceptable with real data
- [ ] Documentation updated with changes

### Architecture Principles

#### 1. Separation of Concerns

- **UI Components**: Handle only UI creation and user interaction
- **Service Layer**: Handle data access and business logic
- **Manager Classes**: Coordinate between components and services
- **Utility Functions**: Provide reusable helper functionality

#### 2. Error Handling Strategy

- **Fail gracefully**: Never crash the entire plugin
- **Provide feedback**: Show meaningful error messages to users
- **Log for debugging**: Include detailed logs for troubleshooting
- **Fallback behavior**: Always have a working fallback state

#### 3. Data Flow Patterns

- **Services → Managers → Components**: Clear data flow direction
- **Event-driven updates**: Use events for real-time data updates
- **Caching strategy**: Cache expensive operations appropriately
- **State management**: Keep component state minimal and focused

### Recovery Procedures

#### 1. When Components Don't Load

1. Check file extensions (`.luau` vs `.client.luau`)
2. Verify require paths in ViewManager
3. Test component creation in isolation
4. Check for syntax errors in component files
5. Rebuild plugin and test again

#### 2. When Services Are Unavailable

1. Implement fallback UI with explanatory messages
2. Add service availability checks
3. Provide manual refresh options
4. Log service status for debugging
5. Gracefully degrade functionality

#### 3. When Data Access Fails

1. Check DataStore service availability
2. Verify API permissions and limits
3. Implement retry mechanisms
4. Show appropriate user feedback
5. Cache last known good state

### Future-Proofing Guidelines

#### 1. Maintainable Code Structure

- **Consistent naming conventions** across all files
- **Clear separation of concerns** between components
- **Comprehensive error handling** at all levels
- **Detailed logging** for troubleshooting
- **Documentation** for all major components

#### 2. Scalability Considerations

- **Modular component design** for easy extension
- **Service-oriented architecture** for flexibility
- **Event-driven communication** for loose coupling
- **Performance monitoring** for optimization
- **Resource management** for large datasets

#### 3. Team Development

- **Code review processes** for quality assurance
- **Shared coding standards** for consistency
- **Documentation requirements** for knowledge sharing
- **Testing protocols** for reliability
- **Version control practices** for collaboration

### Critical Success Factors

1. **Always use correct file extensions** for Roblox/Argon sync
2. **Implement comprehensive error handling** from the start
3. **Test with real data early** to catch integration issues
4. **Document problems and solutions** for future reference
5. **Follow consistent patterns** across all components
6. **Prioritize user experience** even in error scenarios
7. **Maintain professional UI standards** throughout
8. **Plan for service unavailability** from the beginning

### Emergency Recovery Checklist

When the plugin breaks completely:

1. [ ] Check recent file changes for obvious errors
2. [ ] Verify all component files have correct extensions
3. [ ] Test individual components in isolation
4. [ ] Check ViewManager require statements
5. [ ] Rebuild plugin and test basic functionality
6. [ ] Restore from last known working state if needed
7. [ ] Document what went wrong and how it was fixed
8. [ ] Update prevention measures to avoid recurrence

This documentation serves as both a reference and a recovery guide to prevent future architectural issues and ensure consistent development practices.
