## üöÄ Getting Started with Advanced Features

### 1. Enable Features
Access the Feature Registry to enable advanced capabilities:

```lua
local featureRegistry = require("features.FeatureRegistry")
local registry = featureRegistry.new(licenseManager, services)

-- Initialize and load features
registry:initialize()

-- Enable specific features
registry:enableFeature("realTimeMonitor")
registry:enableFeature("bulkOperations")
registry:enableFeature("backupManager")
```

### 2. Access Enhanced Dashboard
The new Enhanced Dashboard provides a unified view of all features:

```lua
local enhancedDashboard = require("ui.dashboards.EnhancedDashboard")
local dashboard = enhancedDashboard.new(services, featureRegistry)

-- Create and show dashboard
dashboard:createDashboard(mainFrame)
dashboard:show()
```

### 3. Use Real-Time Monitoring
Monitor your DataStore performance in real-time:

```lua
local realTimeMonitor = featureRegistry:getFeature("realTimeMonitor")

-- Start monitoring
realTimeMonitor:start()

-- Get current metrics
local metrics = realTimeMonitor:getMetricsSummary()
print("Operations/sec:", metrics.metrics.operations_per_second.current)
print("Average Latency:", metrics.metrics.average_latency.current)
```

### 4. Execute Bulk Operations
Process thousands of records efficiently:

```lua
local bulkOps = featureRegistry:getFeature("bulkOperations")

-- Prepare bulk operation
local items = {}
for i = 1, 1000 do
    table.insert(items, {
        key = "player_" .. i,
        value = {level = i, coins = i * 100}
    })
end

-- Execute with progress tracking
local result = bulkOps:executeBulkOperation("create", items, {
    batchSize = 25,
    delay = 0.1,
    maxRetries = 3
})

-- Monitor progress
bulkOps:addProgressCallback(result.operationId, function(progress)

        progress.percentage, progress.processed, progress.total))
end)
```
