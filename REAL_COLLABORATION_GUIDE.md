# Real Multi-User Collaboration Guide

_DataStore Manager Pro - Team Collaboration System_

## 🎯 Overview

The DataStore Manager Pro now includes a **real multi-user collaboration system** that enables actual team coordination using invitation codes. This replaces the previous mock data with genuine user management and role-based permissions.

## 🚀 How It Works

### For Project Owners (Root Admin)

1. **Generate Invitation Codes**

   - Navigate to "🤝 Team & Sessions" tab
   - Select appropriate role for team member
   - Choose expiry time (1-168 hours)
   - Click "🎟️ Generate Code"
   - Share the 8-character code with your team member

2. **Role Hierarchy**

   - **👑 OWNER** - Full system access (you, the root admin)
   - **🔧 ADMIN** - Can manage team, perform most operations, generate codes
   - **✏️ EDITOR** - Read/write data, modify schemas, limited analytics
   - **👁️ VIEWER** - Read-only access to data and analytics
   - **👤 GUEST** - Limited access to basic data viewing

3. **Code Management**
   - View active invitation codes
   - Monitor code usage and expiry
   - Revoke access as needed
   - Track team member activity

### For Team Members (Joining)

1. **Joining a Project**

   - Click "🤝 Join Team" button in the sidebar
   - Enter your display name
   - Enter the 8-character invitation code
   - Click "🚀 Join Team"

2. **After Joining**
   - You'll have access based on your assigned role
   - Your actions are logged and monitored
   - Collaborate in real-time with the team
   - Respect the permissions hierarchy

## 🔐 Security Features

- **Encrypted Token Storage** - All user tokens are securely stored
- **Session Management** - Automatic timeout and cleanup
- **Audit Logging** - All user actions are tracked
- **Role-Based Permissions** - Granular access control
- **Code Expiry** - Invitation codes have time limits
- **Usage Limits** - Codes can be single-use or limited

## 💼 Use Cases

### Development Team

- **Owner**: Lead developer with full access
- **Admins**: Senior developers who can manage team and perform bulk operations
- **Editors**: Junior developers who can modify data and schemas
- **Viewers**: QA team members who need read-only access

### Client Project

- **Owner**: You (the developer)
- **Admins**: Client's technical team
- **Viewers**: Client stakeholders who need progress visibility
- **Guests**: External reviewers with minimal access

### Educational Setting

- **Owner**: Instructor with full control
- **Editors**: Teaching assistants who can modify examples
- **Viewers**: Students who can explore data
- **Guests**: Guest lecturers with limited access

## 🛠️ Technical Implementation

### Real User System

```lua
-- Each user gets a real session with:
{
    userId = "user_developer_1703123456",
    userName = "John Developer",
    role = "EDITOR",
    permissions = {...},
    sessionId = "session_1703123456_789123",
    joinedAt = 1703123456,
    lastActive = 1703123456,
    status = "online"
}
```

### Invitation Code System

```lua
-- Codes are generated with:
{
    code = "9QYAUSQ5",
    targetRole = "EDITOR",
    expiresAt = timestamp + (24 * 3600),
    maxUses = 1,
    inviterUserId = "user_7768610061",
    isActive = true
}
```

### Permission Checking

```lua
-- Real-time permission validation:
if userManager:hasPermission(userId, "WRITE_DATA") then
    -- Allow data modification
else
    -- Show read-only interface
end
```

## 📋 Step-by-Step Collaboration Setup

### Initial Setup (Owner)

1. Open DataStore Manager Pro in Roblox Studio
2. Navigate to "🤝 Team & Sessions"
3. Read the Quick Start Guide at the top
4. Generate your first invitation code for an EDITOR role

### Adding Team Members

1. **For Developers**: Use EDITOR or ADMIN role

   ```
   Role: EDITOR
   Expiry: 24 hours
   Generate Code: EDITOR123
   ```

2. **For Stakeholders**: Use VIEWER role

   ```
   Role: VIEWER
   Expiry: 72 hours (3 days)
   Generate Code: VIEW456
   ```

3. **For Temporary Access**: Use GUEST role
   ```
   Role: GUEST
   Expiry: 2 hours
   Generate Code: GUEST789
   ```

### Team Member Onboarding

### Team Management

- Start with VIEWER roles, upgrade as needed
- Use descriptive display names
- Monitor the activity feed regularly
- Communicate role changes to team
- Have a backup admin in case you're unavailable

### Code Generation

- Generate codes just before sharing
- Use shorter expiry for sensitive access

- Document who receives each code
- Revoke unused codes promptly

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Invalid invitation code"**

- Check if code has expired
- Verify code was typed correctly (case-sensitive)
- Confirm code hasn't reached usage limit

**"User already exists"**

- Different display name required
- Previous session may still be active
- Contact project owner to resolve

**"Insufficient permissions"**

- Role doesn't allow this action
- Contact admin for role upgrade
- Check feature access matrix

**"Connection failed"**

- Studio plugin DataStore issue
- Restart Roblox Studio
